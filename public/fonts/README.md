# Font Placeholder

This directory contains placeholder files for fonts that were previously loaded from CDNs but had 404 errors.

The site now uses Google Fonts (Bebas Neue and Inter) as alternatives, but keeps the original font names in the CSS to maintain compatibility with existing designs.

If you have the actual font files, place them here with the correct filenames:
- DrukText-Medium.woff
